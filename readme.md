# ReactJS Training 

Based on _Plural Sight_ tutorials:

1. [ReactJS Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started) -> Folder: `01-react-js-getting-started`
2. [ReactJS Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-fundamentals) -> Folder: `02-react-fundamentals`

### Intro
Each subfolder is a completely different and standalone ReactJS application.
For starting you could checkout `01-react-js-getting-started/00-boilterplate-react` project to start using it and create something from scratch.


### Getting Started

When you are over one subfolder/project. Please execute these both commands 

```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

`npm start` will use npm/webpack/babel to compile JSX and serve the app locally on: http://localhost:8080
